  "description": "Strict quality gate that runs after autonomous agent work to ensure no TypeScript compile errors, no lint errors (warnings treated as errors), and consistent formatting. Auto-fixes issues when possible during autonomous execution.",

  "outputPrompt": "🚨 AUTONOMOUS TYPESCRIPT QUALITY GATE: This autonomous task is NOT complete until all quality checks pass. Execute these steps automatically:\n\n**STEP 1: Quick Check**\n```bash\nnpm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run type-check\n```\n\n**STEP 2: Auto-Fix (if errors found)**\n```bash\nnpm run lint:fix && npm run format\n```\n\n**STEP 3: Re-validate**\n```bash\nnpm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run type-check\n```\n\n**STEP 4: Manual Fix (if auto-fix insufficient)**\n- Fix remaining TypeScript errors manually\n- Ensure ESLint passes with --max-warnings=0\n- Verify Prettier formatting consistency\n- Re-run checks until ALL pass\n\n**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**\n✅ TypeScript compilation passes (no type errors)\n✅ ESLint passes with zero warnings/errors\n✅ Prettier formatting is consistent\n✅ All tests pass (if applicable)\n\n**If toolchain is missing, set up automatically:**\n- TypeScript with strict configuration\n- ESLint with TypeScript integration\n- Prettier with consistent rules\n- Vitest for testing\n\n**CRITICAL:** Do not mark this autonomous task as complete until this quality gate passes. The multi-agent architecture system requires production-ready code quality at all times.\n\n**Report Status:** After completing quality checks, provide a brief summary:\n- ✅ All quality checks passed\n- 🔧 Issues found and auto-fixed\n- ❌ Manual intervention required (with details)",
