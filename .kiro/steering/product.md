# Product Overview

## Multi-Agent Software Architecture Design System

This project implements a production-ready MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that orchestrates 40+ specialized AI agents to automate complete software architecture design processes. The system transforms business requirements into comprehensive architecture documentation including C4 diagrams, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and detailed implementation plans.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Automated Architecture Design**: From requirements analysis through implementation planning
- **40+ Specialized Agents**: Each agent focuses on specific architectural domains (security, data, infrastructure, AI/ML, etc.)
- **Production Documentation**: Generates complete architecture blueprints with ADRs, diagrams, and implementation roadmaps
- **MCP Server Integration**: Works seamlessly with Claude Code and other MCP-compatible tools

### Key Differentiators

- **Architecture-Specific Focus**: Unlike general development agents, this system specifically targets architecture design as a distinct problem space
- **Dynamic Agent Factory**: Can create ephemeral agents for emerging technologies not covered by the core 40 agents
- **Parallel Orchestration**: Executes agents in parallel where possible while respecting dependencies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms to detect and resolve conflicting architectural decisions

### Target Users

- Software architects designing new systems
- Development teams needing architecture guidance
- Organizations standardizing architecture practices
- Consultants providing architecture services

### System Scope

**In Scope:**

- Requirements analysis and translation
- Architecture style selection and justification
- Technology stack recommendations
- Security and compliance architecture
- Performance and scalability design
- Implementation planning and task breakdown

**Out of Scope:**

- Actual code implementation
- Project management beyond architecture tasks
- Business strategy or product decisions
- Detailed UI/UX design
